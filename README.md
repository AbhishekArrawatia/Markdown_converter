**Run the following commands to set up the code locally**
1. clone the repository locally
2. cd backend
3. npm install
4. node index.js
5. cd ..
5. cd frontend
6. npm install
7. npm run dev

**Ideas for further improvement if given more time**
1. create a user sign-in and login functionality.
2. Allow users to store their markdowns which they can edit and delete (CRUD operations).
3. Implement docker compose file in the application for easy local setup and deployment.
4. Dark theme functionality by maintaining a gloabal state in frontend.
